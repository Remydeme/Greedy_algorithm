## Frequently Asked Questions

__What is the greedy algorithm ?__

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal
choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in
general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that
approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.
