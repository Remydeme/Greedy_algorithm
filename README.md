# GREEDY ALGORITHM

__The project tagline is cool and witty__

This is where you write a paragrah or so describing your project to the person
reading it knows what your project is all about. You could skip this part but
after all the hard work you put into creating your project, it would be a shame
if nobody ever used it, because you didn't take the time to explain it to them.
You don't have to write a lot - just enough to get them interested.

## Frequently Asked Questions

__What is the greedy algorithm ?__

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal
choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in
general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that
approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.
